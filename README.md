## Introduction
In this project, I have done exploratory data analysis of the 911 Calls dataset (from this [kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert). It is based on the ["Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" from John Portilla, at Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/).


 ## Objectives

The objective was to learn and exercise some capabilities of the following Python libraries:
* Pandas
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib
